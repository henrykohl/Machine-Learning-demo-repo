Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Saint Petersburg at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac\\'s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (\"princess\") on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter\\'s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.\\nAs a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education.

While the accession of James went smoothly, the succession had been the subject of much debate for decades. In some scholarly views, it was a major political factor of the entire reign, even if not so voiced.

Margaret Douglas was a daughter of Margaret Tudor, and lived to 1578, but became a marginal figure in discussions of the succession to Elizabeth I, who at no point clarified the dynastic issues of the Tudor line. When in 1565 Margaret Douglas\\'s elder son Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, married Mary, Queen of Scots, the \"Lennox claim\" was generally regarded as consolidated into the \"Stuart claim\".\\n\\n\\n=== Stuart claimants ===\\nJames VI was the son of two grandchildren of Margaret Tudor. Arbella Stuart, the most serious other contender by the late 16th century, was the daughter of Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox\\'s younger son Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox.\\nJames VI\\'s mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a plausible successor to the English throne. At the beginning of Elizabeth\\'s reign she sent ambassadors to England when a parliament was summoned, anticipating a role for parliament in settling the succession in her favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and her proximity to the succession was a factor in plotting, making her position a political problem for the English government, eventually resolved by judicial means. She was executed in 1587. In that year Mary\\'s son James reached the age of twenty-one, while Arbella was only twelve.\\n\\n\\n=== Suffolk claimants ===\\nWhile the Stuart line of James and Arbella would have had political support, by 1600 the descendants of Mary Tudor were theoretically relevant, and on legal grounds could not be discounted. Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk, and Eleanor Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, both had children who were in the line of succession. Frances and Eleanor were Mary Tudor\\'s daughters by her second husband, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Frances married Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and they had three daughters, Lady Jane Grey (1537–1554), Lady Catherine Grey (1540–1568), and Lady Mary Grey (1545–1578).

Her parents were Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia and Catherine. Catherine was the daughter of Samuel Skowroński, a subject of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although no documentary record exists, her parents were said to have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Saint Petersburg at some point between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Their official marriage was at Saint Isaac\\'s Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to the couple (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimised by their father and given the title of Tsarevna (\"princess\") on 6 March 1711. Of the twelve children born to Peter and Catherine (five sons and seven daughters), only the sisters survived to adulthood. They had one older surviving sibling, crown prince Alexei Petrovich, who was Peter\\'s son by his first wife, noblewoman Eudoxia Lopukhina.\\nAs a child, Elizabeth was the favourite of her father, whom she resembled both physically and temperamentally. Even though he adored his daughter, Peter did not devote time or attention to her education; having both a son and grandson from his first marriage to a noblewoman, he did not anticipate that a daughter born to his former maid might one day inherit the Russian throne, which had until that point never been occupied by a woman; as such, it was left to Catherine to raise the girls, a task met with considerable difficulty due to her own lack of education. Despite this, Elizabeth was still ', metadata={'title': 'Elizabeth of Russia', 'summary': \"Elizabeth or Elizaveta Petrovna (Russian: Елизаве́та Петро́вна; 29 December [O.S. 18 December] 1709 – 5 January [O.S. 25 December] 1762) was Empress of Russia from 1741 until her death in 1762. She remains one of the most popular Russian monarchs because of her decision not to execute a single person during her reign, her numerous construction projects, and her strong opposition to Prussian policies.\\nThe second-eldest daughter of Tsar Peter the Great (r.\\u20091682–1725), Elizabeth lived through the confused successions of her father's descendants following her half-brother Alexei's death in 1718. The throne first passed to her mother Catherine I of Russia (r.\\u20091725–1727), then to her nephew Peter II, who died in 1730 and was succeeded by Elizabeth's first cousin Anna (r.\\u20091730–1740). After the brief rule of Anna's infant great-nephew, Ivan VI, Elizabeth seized the throne with the military's support and declared her own nephew, the future Peter III, her heir.\\nDuring her reign Elizabeth continued the policies of her father and brought about a remarkable Age of Enlightenment in Russia. Her domestic policies allowed the nobles to gain dominance in local government while shortening their terms of service to the state. She encouraged Mikhail Lomonosov's foundation of the University of Moscow, the highest-ranking Russian educational institution. Her court became one of the most splendid in all Europe, especially regarding architecture: she modernised Russia's roads, encouraged Ivan Shuvalov's foundation of the Imperial Academy of Arts, and financed grandiose Baroque projects of her favourite architect, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, particularly in Peterhof Palace. The Winter Palace and the Smolny Cathedral in Saint Petersburg are among the chief monuments of her reign.\\nElizabeth led the Russian Empire during the two major European conflicts of her time: the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748) and the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). She and diplomat Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin solved the first event by forming an alliance with Austria and France, but indirectly caused the second. Russian troops enjoyed several victories against Prussia and briefly occupied Berlin, but when Frederick the Great was finally considering surrender in January 1762, the Russian Empress died. She was the last agnatic member of the House of Romanov to reign over the Russian Empire.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Russia'})),\n"," GraphDocument(nodes=[Node(id='Elizabeth I', type='Person'), Node(id='James Vi Of Scotland', type='Person'), Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), Node(id='Edward Vi', type='Person'), Node(id='Mary I', type='Person'), Node(id='Jane Grey', type='Person'), Node(id='Katherine Grey', type='Person'), Node(id='Mary Grey', type='Person'), Node(id='Margaret Clifford', type='Person'), Node(id='Margaret Tudor', type='Person'), Node(id='Margaret Douglas', type='Person'), Node(id='Henry Stuart', type='Person'), Node(id='Mary, Queen Of Scots', type='Person')], relationships=[Relationship(source=Node(id='Elizabeth I', type='Person'), target=Node(id='James Vi Of Scotland', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Edward Vi', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Mary I', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Elizabeth I', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Jane Grey', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Katherine Grey', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Mary Grey', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Viii', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Margaret Clifford', type='Person'), type='SUCCEEDED_TO'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Mary I', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Margaret Douglas', type='Person'), type='PREFERRED_SUCCESSOR'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Margaret Douglas', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Henry Stuart', type='Person'), type='FAMILY_RELATIONSHIP'), Relationship(source=Node(id='Henry Stuart', type='Person'), target=Node(id='Mary, Queen Of Scots', type='Person'), type='MARRIED_TO')], source=Document(page_content='The succession to the childless Elizabeth I was an open question from her accession in 1558 to her death in 1603, when the crown passed to James VI of Scotland.
